> &#128077;&#127998; These are good, thought provoking questions, even for someone like me who has already had a long and successful career.  That's why I've taken the time to answer them.

Give me an example of the project or initiative that you started on your own. It can be a non-business one. What prompted you to get started?

> I started PCLIC, a non-profit devoted to Promoting Computer Literacy in Children by providing pro-bono workshops and maintaining a website of resources at <http://pclic.org>.  Among my motivations were to suggest career opportunities for young children, to help promote a more diverse workforce, and to help create a citizenry more informed about computing.

Tell me about a time you had to work on several projects at once. How did you handle this?

> When on the faculty at Dartmouth, I spearheaded creating an undergraduate major in computer science and a masters program in computer and information science.  I was also the chairman of the College Board Committee that created the AP Course in Computer Science and the vice chair of the ANSI X3/J2 Basic Standards Committee.  I handled this by staggering, as best I could, deadlines for these activities so I could devote full time to them as they approached.

Describe a situation in which you felt you had not communicated well enough. What did you do? How did you handle it?

> When the masters program I had started at Dartmouth was coming up for review, I should have communicated with more people before the public discussion of the program, at which I was not given ample opportunity to speak.  It would have been better to meet privately with people before the public meeting.

Tell me about when you had to deal with conflict within your team. How was the conflict solved? How did you handle that? How would you deal with it now?

> Fortunately I never had to deal with much conflict within my teams, bit I did have a major conflict with the director of my laboratory at MIT over my salary.  One year grants to fund my salary were slow in coming through, and I allowed myself to be pressured into going on half salary for the next year.  Financially half salary worked out well: I arranged a lucrative consulting project.  It did not work out well for my research.  The grants were funded, but my new consulting obligations did not leave me time to do the research and I was unable further a collaboration I had begun with a junior colleague.  I don't know how I would deal with such a conflict again.  Perhaps by passing up the consulting and taking the risk that funding (or another consulting opportunity) would come through.

Give me an example of a time you had to take a creative and unusual approach to solve coding problem. How did this idea come to your mind? Why do you think it was unusual?

> My first major coding project in the early 1960s was an ALGOL compiler for the LGP-30, a computer with only 16KB of magnetic drum memory and punched paper tape for input/output.  To make programs load more quickly, a created dump/load routines that did not access memory locations sequentially, which would have created pauses while the drum rotated until locations were available, but rather access memory locations in the order in which they would become available.  Loading became so fast that a computer repair technician thought the tape reader was broken: he had never seen it read tape so quickly,

Describe a situation in which you worked diligently on a project and it did not produce the desired results. Why didn't you get the desired results? What did you learn from the experience?

> I worked diligently on developing Formula Forge, an add-in for Microsoft Excel, but have not yet succeeded in turning it into a successful commercial product.  Neither my partners, who were successful entrepreneurs, nor I had any experience in marketing software.  What we learned was that we need someone with that kind of experience.

Give an example of an important project goal you reached and how you achieved it.

> A year ago I reached the goal of deploying Formula Forge in the Microsoft AppSource marketplace.  Getting there involved a long, but satisfying period of product design and development, followed by months of frustration dealing with Microsoft's flawed system of business and product certification.  I finally made contact with a customer service rep who helped get our documents to the right department, even if doing so was outside the rep's area of responsibility.

Describe a situation in which you experienced difficulty in getting others to accept your ideas? What was your approach? How did this work? Were you able to successfully persuade someone to see things your way?

> When I sought to create an undergraduate major in computer science at Dartmouth, I had to overcome resistance within the mathematics department to housing the major there (even though members of that department had created the Basic programming language and the Dartmouth Time Sharing System).  Some felt students interested in careers in computing would be served best by majoring in mathematics.  Others thought computer science belonged in the engineering school.  I cited educational benefits and enrollments to counter these opinions.  Some pre-med students major in mathematics because it might help them in their careers, but others might find a major in computer science more attractive.  Some courses relevant to computer science (computability, probability) have significant mathematical content and are best offered by the math department.  These arguments persuaded enough people to go ahead.

Tell me about a situation when you were responsible for project planning. Did everything go according to your plan? If not, then why and what kind of counteractions did you have to take?

> As a professor, I developed many courses that Dartmouth had not offered before,  and I was responsible for all aspects of these course: the syllabus, the schedule, the lectures, the exams, office hours, and teaching assistants.  Things rarely went exactly as planned: the schedule slipped, the lectures were not clear enough, the exams were too easy or too hard, ...  I had to skip material to get back on schedule, repeat material that was not properly understood, adjust my grading, etc.

Tell me about a situation when you made a mistake at work. What happened exactly and how did you deal with it? What steps did you take to improve the situation?

> At MIT, I was responsible for developing a system for automated reasoning in what is known as first-order logic.  Once, when I added a new method of inference to the system, I made a mistake (regarding variables bound by quantifiers) that produced proofs of results that were not true.  I dealt with this problem, as I had with smaller problems in parsing, by creating regression tests, that is, unit tests designed to ensure that changes to the system did not break anything that was working before.

Tell me about a time when you worked with someone who was not completing his or her share of the work. How did you handle the situation? Did you discuss your concern with your coworker? With your manager? If yes, how did your coworker respond to your concern? What was your manager's response?

> I once hired a programmer to assist with a research project.  I had to let him go because he did do satisfactory work, even after I reduced my expectations for what he could accomplish.  His attitude was that the job gave him freedom to pursue his own interests, not necessarily those of the project.  I discussed the matter with a faculty colleague, who suggested we hire a student instead of a staff member.

Describe a situation when you worked effectively under pressure. How did you feel when working under pressure? What was going on, and how did you get through it?

> I worked for several years on the team that developed the Dartmouth Time Sharing System for the GE 265.  The effort suffered from what Fred Brooks described as the _second system effect_: the success of an earlier system led to a project that was far too ambitious and took far longer to complete.  We worked very hard on graveyard shifts to get the job done.  Our effort paid off, but it took a toll!

Tell me about yourself.

> My answers to the other questions tell a lot about me.  My wife and I moved from Cambridge, MA, to Philadelphia ten years ago to live near the one grandchild we had at the time.  We now have seven (soon to be eight), three here in Philadelphia and the others in London.  I enjoy teaching them all how to code.  In addition to our grandchildren, I also enjoy cooking, reading, classical music, bluegrass and folk, theater, woodworking, and walking in the woods (an age-adjusted substitute for hiking in the White Mountains).

Tell me about your experience at Resilient Coders.

> As a mentor, I enjoy getting to know students and helping them learn.  I know a lot about computer science, but not so much about some of the back-end technologies that RC teaches.  This gives me a chance to model how I go about finding the information I need to get a job done.

What do you know about our company?

Why do you want to work for us?

> With respect to RC, I believe a more diverse workforce (women and minorities) would put the computer industry in a better position to understand and meet the needs of the general public.  It also produce opportunities for reducing income inequality.
>
> The reasons I would want to work for other companies include a belief in their goals, opportunities to apply and further my skills, and a culture of collaboration.

Why are you interested in this opportunity?

Tell me about your dream job? What do you really want to do with your career?

> I had my dream jobs teaching mathematics and computer science at leading universities.

Tell me a time when you failed.

> I failed at my first attempt to pass the oral qualifying exams for my PhD.  It was a class example of the Peter Principle: I had always earned good grades and did well on tests, so I did not realize I had risen to the level of my incompetence.

What do you read on a regular basis?

> Lots of different things.  Books, both fiction and nonfiction.  The New York Times, the New Yorker, PA Post, and Foreign Affairs.  The Communications of the ACM.  TLDR, TechRepublic, and other tech newsletters on the web.

What's some critical feedback you've gotten recently?

> I tend to be too much of a perfectionist.  I need to loosen up.

Do you have any questions?
