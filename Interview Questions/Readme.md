## Advice about interviews

An interview is not a test.  It's an opportunity for you to project your strengths, to find out more about the company conducting the interview, and to help you decide if you really want to work there.

If you do not know the answer to a question, don't be afraid to say so.  What's important is to project confidence in what you know and in your ability to find additional information when you need it.

Frame answers to technical questions to convey a familiarity with the concept, not to provide overly detailed information.  Interviewers can always ask follow-up questions if they want more details.  Use your answers to steer the follow-up questions and interview in directions that play to your strengths.

If you find part of a question confusing, answer a part that makes some sense.  If interviewers want an answer to a different part, they will ask for it, perhaps in a way that makes more sense.

Don't try to anticipate where interviewers want to go.  Avoid giving them hints about directions that would make you uncomfortable.
